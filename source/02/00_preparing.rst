Preparing development environment
=====================================

Prepare environment to develop iRIC solvers.

* To develop with C/C++, you can use Visual C/C++ 2013 or newer.
* To develop with FORTRAN, you can use Intel Fortran 2015 or newer.

When building solvers, you need to link against cgnslib and iriclib.

Headers and Libraries are bundled with iRIC GUI. If you've installed to standard folder, they are stored
in the folder below:

C:\\Users\\(userid)\\iRIC\\guis\\prepost\\sdk
