Examples of calculation conditions, boundary conditions, and grid generating condition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of definitions of calculating conditions in solver definition
files, grid generating condition if grid generating program definition
file is shown in this section. The position to describe the definition
differs like shown in :numref:`where_to_define_element`,
but the grammers are the same. Refer to
:ref:`def_structure` for the whole structure of each file.

.. _where_to_define_element:

.. csv-table:: Position to define definition elements
   :file: where_to_define_element.csv
   :header-rows: 1

The types of items available, are shown in
:numref:`definition_file_widget_types`. In this
subsection, the followings are described fore each type:

-  Definition example
-  Example of the corresponding widget shown on calculation condition
   edit dialog in iRIC
-  Code example to load the values in solvers (or grid generating
   program).


In code examples to load the values, subroutines in iRIClib are used.
Please refer to :ref:`about_iriclib` to know more about iRIClib.

The examples only
show the sample codes for loading, so please refer to :ref:`how_to_dev_solver`,
:ref:`how_to_dev_gridgen` to see examples of whole programs.
